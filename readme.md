# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Introduction
This project explores the use of Convolutional Nerual Networks to find a better generalized model than regular supervised learning models in classifying whether a question asked on the Quora's platform is sincere or not.

## Dataset used:
  - [Quora insincere Questions - Competition Page Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data)
  - [GloVe 100d](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
    - No need to upload/download it, wget command with link in jupyter file to download directly to the root folder
## Python Version:
  - Python 3.7

## Libraries used:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - Imblearn
  - Keras with Tensorflow backend
